## Security

The maintainers of this project take security seriously, and the reporting of potential security issues. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any CoreWCF repository that meets [Microsoft's definition of a security vulnerability](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/tn-archive/cc751383(v=technet.10)), please report it to us as described below.

We are using Microsoft's vulnerability definition as it is public and familiar to .NET users.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them to the project maintainers using **[security@corewcf.net](mailto:security@corewcf.net)**
You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message. 

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

  * Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Policy

CoreWCF follows the [GitHub CVD process](https://github.blog/2022-02-09-coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure-cvd-open-source-projects/) and will use [GHSA](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/about-github-security-advisories) to manage discussion of the vulnerability and fixes, and create a public CVE advisory through github if applicable.
