    // This cache works like a MruCache, but operates loosely and without locks in the mainline path.
    //
    // It consists of three 'hoppers', which are Hashtables (chosen for their nice threading characteristics - reading
    // doesn't require a lock).  Items enter the cache in the second hopper.  On lookups, cache hits result in the
    // cache entry being promoted to the first hopper.  When the first hopper is full, the third hopper is dropped,
    // and the first and second hoppers are shifted down, leaving an empty first hopper.  If the second hopper is
    // full when a new cache entry is added, the third hopper is dropped, the second hopper is shifted down, and a
    // new second hopper is slotted in to become the new item entrypoint.
    //
    // Items can only be added and looked up.  There's no way to remove an item besides through attrition.
    //
    // This cache has a built-in concept of weakly-referenced items (which can be enabled or disabled in the
    // constructor).  It needs this concept since the caller of the cache can't remove dead cache items itself.
    // A weak HopperCache will simply ignore dead entries.
    //
    // This structure allows cache lookups to be almost lock-free.  The only time the first hopper is written to
    // is when a cache entry is promoted.  Promoting a cache entry is not critical - it's ok to skip a promotion.
    // Only one promotion is allowed at a time.  If a second is attempted, it is skipped.  This allows promotions
    // to be synchronized with just an Interlocked call.
    //
    // New cache entries go into the second hopper, which requires a lock, as does shifting the hoppers down.
    //
    // The hopperSize parameter determines the size of the first hopper.  When it reaches this size, the hoppers
    // are shifted.  The second hopper is allowed to grow to twice this size.  This is because it needs room to get
    // new cache entries into the system, and the second hopper typically starts out 'full'.  Entries are never added
    // directly to the third hopper.
    //
    // It's a error on the part of the caller to add the same key to the cache again if it's already in the cache
    // with a different value.  The new value will not necessarily overwrite the old value.
    //
    // If a cache entry is about to be promoted from the third hopper, and in the mean time the third hopper has been
    // shifted away, an intervening GetValue for the same key might return null, even though the item is still in
    // the cache and a later GetValue might find it.  So it's very important never to add the same key to the cache
    // with two different values, even if GetValue returns null for the key in-between the first add and the second.
    // (If this particular behavior is a problem, it may be possible to tighten up, but it's not necessary for the
    // current use of HopperCache - UriPrefixTable.)
